# Stock Tren Prediction using Deep Learning


Overview

This project is a comprehensive stock market prediction system built in Python. It leverages various libraries and machine learning models to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The core technologies used include Pandas for data manipulation, YFinance for data retrieval, Keras for building predictive models, and Streamlit for creating an interactive user interface.

Features

	•	Data Retrieval: Fetch historical stock price data using the YFinance library.
	•	Data Processing: Clean and preprocess data using Pandas.
	•	Modeling: Use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) models to predict stock prices.
	•	Visualization: Interactive dashboard with Streamlit to visualize predictions and historical data.

Tech Stack

	•	Python: Programming language used for the project.
	•	Streamlit: Framework for creating interactive web applications.

Importance of Stock Price Prediction

Stock price prediction is a critical component in financial markets, offering valuable insights to traders, investors, and financial analysts. Accurate forecasting of stock prices can lead to:

	1.	Informed Decision-Making:
Investors and traders can make well-informed decisions based on predicted stock price movements. This can help in optimizing investment strategies and improving the chances of achieving higher returns.
	2.	Risk Management:
By predicting future stock prices, individuals and institutions can better assess potential risks and manage their portfolios more effectively. This can be particularly useful in mitigating losses and making strategic adjustments.
	3.	Market Trends Analysis:
Understanding price trends and patterns helps in analyzing market behavior. This can provide insights into market cycles, helping investors anticipate significant market movements.

Advantages of This Project

	1.	Data-Driven Predictions:
The project uses historical stock price data to build predictive models. This data-driven approach ensures that predictions are based on actual market trends and patterns.
	2.	Advanced Machine Learning Techniques:
By employing advanced techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), the project enhances the accuracy of predictions. LSTM networks are particularly well-suited for time-series forecasting, making them ideal for stock price prediction.
	3.	Interactive Visualization:
The integration with Streamlit provides an interactive and user-friendly interface. Users can easily visualize historical data, predictions, and trends, making it accessible even to those who may not have a technical background.
	4.	Customizable and Extendable:
The project can be extended and customized to include additional features, such as incorporating more complex models or integrating real-time data feeds. This flexibility allows users to adapt the tool to their specific needs.
